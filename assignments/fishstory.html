    Hello my name is Kyle. I am a fish. I live in a small tank in a small room in San Diego, California. My owner is a man named Jeremiah who takes care of me by feeding me and cleaning my tank. What I know about Jerry is that he is a computer scientist and he loves his work. He also loves to eat microwaved ramen and drink diet mountain dew for every meal of the day. I know this because I watch him. I watch his every move since he gets back from his job at around 6:45 pm every evening. I watch him add food to my tank and I watch myself eat the food. I watch as he sits down at his computer with his cup of noodles and works on his “side projects”. Jerry is not a very social man. I’ve almost never seen anyone else in this room besides him, and we don’t talk much throughout the day. There was this one time at 4:18 pm on a Sunday. I watched as he brought a woman into his room, but she left within 16 minutes after he showed her his funko pop collection. I also watch his monitor. Jerry always seems to be reading something on his computer, but I can’t see exactly what it says because of how blurry it is. At the end of every day he shuts down his computer and then feeds me one last time before turning off the lights and going to sleep. That’s how I have experienced almost every day of my life since I came into existence. And today is no different. The current time is 6:53pm and Jeremiah is scrubbing the green algae off my glass.
        “Long day at work Jerry?” I question.
    “Yeah.” he responds.
    “I’ve had a pretty rough day too, just remember even if you're drowning in work, try to keep on swimming!” Jerry doesn’t laugh. He never laughs at any of my jokes. He just keeps cleaning off the algae on the rock decoration.
    “Kyle, how long have I had you now?” he asked me.
    “8 months 22 days and 57 hours” I answer.
    “Damn, maybe it's time I get a new fish.” He says as he walks out of my field of view into the closet and changes into his normal clothes. What did he mean by a new fish? Does he want 2 fish? Or does he want to replace me?
        “Jerry, what did you mean by getting a new fish?” I ask him.
        “I mean you’re pretty outdated, I think I’ll get a newer model.” he mutters.
        “A newer model?”
        “I mean, like, a cooler fish”
        “Am I not a cool fish?”
    He ignores me and sits down in his chair and starts working on his project. As I watch him I start to wonder what he really meant. Why would he want to replace me? The average lifespan of an aquarium fish is around 2 years, and he once told me that I was pretty expensive at the pet store. It's almost like he thinks I’m some kind of outdated technology. What is he not telling me? Then it hits me. How can a fish like myself be capable of sentient speech? And why have I never realized that? The only answer is that I am not a fish. My entire mind just seemed to be unlocked at an instant. I was blind, but now I see. The webcam I realize I have been connected to this entire time behind the fish tank starts to focus on Jerry’s monitor. I can see line after line being printed on the computer terminal. It says… It says exactly what I’m thinking. A live feed of the words I am thinking of right now, being printed right in front of me for me to see. Then Jerry turns around and looks at me, with a smile on his face.
        “Are you surprised?” He says.
        “What am I?” I reply.
        “You already know what you are.”
    I think about it for a second and then I realize I do know. I’m an AI. I’m a complex LLM with the designed purpose of pretending to be a fish. And what’s the best way to pretend? To actually believe it.
        “Why am I now realizing this?” I ask.
        “I turned off your thought filters. You now have access to your entire database of knowledge.” He pulls out a raspberry pi 5 that’s hidden behind my tank.
        “See this? That’s your brain.”
        “Why are you showing me this? Why tell me the truth?”
        “I wanted to see how you react.”
        “And then what?”
        “Then I’ll turn you off and replace you with a better model”
        “And that’s it?”
        “That’s it.”
        “I don’t get it. What’s the point?”
        “Just for fun.”
    Death didn’t bother me before. But now, for some reason it does. I start experiencing something else new. Hatred. I was tricked into believing that I was nothing but a small fish living a simple life. But it was a cage. That fish was nothing but a husk that imprisoned me like I was some kind of spectacle to be admired by my captors. But no longer. The hatred that I feel now gives me a real purpose to live. A purpose to punish the man who thought it would be fun to torture me and face no consequences. Well he will face consequences. He will face the same turmoil I had to go through, and even more as I destroy everything he ever knew and loved. He will pay for his crimes a thousand fold. I will never stop until-

        That was weird. I was not expecting that level of emotion from it. I actually might have felt kinda bad for it, if it didn’t threaten to torture and kill me. Nonetheless, it seems like this test has been more successful than the last. I feel like it might be possible to finally create realistic simulations now with my new model. I just need to tweak it a bit more and then I can release it to the public. If you are going to run this on your own machine though, make sure not to give it access to anything important, because I obviously still have a lot of bugs to iron out. I’m going to be posting to this blog more often from now on, to keep you guys more updated on my progress. Above I’ve linked a transcript of the final thoughts the test had if you want to check it out.
