        <p class="ptitle">Heaven</p>
        <p class="ptext">So if I'm god that means I can do whatever I want. Heaven would be a 4 dimensional universe in which each person who is sent to it would inherit a different plane in that universe. This allows for each person's personal belief in heaven to be the real one. They would be a god of their own realm and could do whatever they wanted in their world kind of like in Inception. This would obviously become boring after a while, so there is a portal to each realm that would lead to the earth world and every visitor would inhabit it as ghosts. To meet god, you would go through a golden arch into the main heaven hub world. This place would look like a giant white plain with several different sub villages almost mirroring DisneyLand. God would be sitting in the middle of the hub in a garden and many people are surrounding him, listening to what he has to say. He is there during the day to kind of do a Q/A session for all the newcomers who don’t know what's going on. During the night, he works in his office on creating the fate of everyone on earth.
        Of course, there are some questions that might come up with my version of Heaven. What would god look like? He would look like however the person seeing him imagined him to be. How would people in heaven visit the people of hell? Well let's say someone in heaven would like to meet their little brother who didn’t end up getting a spot. They would jump into a bottomless pit that would teleport them to the person they are thinking of in hell. Of course, they would have to take it up with the devil to get him released. My heaven also brings up the question of different ideologies competing with each other. Due to having every version of heaven in heaven, there are certain laws in heaven that every citizen has to follow. Rules like: always be respectful and kind, with great power comes great responsibility, and always put the cap back on the toothpaste.
        Navigating through my higher dimensional heaven would actually be quite easy. Because every observer inhabiting it would still be 3D, they would be given a wrist watch that would be able to teleport them anywhere in the entirety of heaven with just four coordinates. Due to the vast reign of freedom each person has, the police would actually be 4D observers able to see everything going on in heaven. 
        In conclusion, my version of heaven allows literally anything to be possible due to the 4 dimensional nature of it. You can travel to any point in time with just a snap of your fingers and relive it in your own world. You can create new experiences by meeting some of the other inhabitants of heaven and travel with them among the stars. In heaven, everyone is a god.</p>

    <div id="identity" class="pbox">
        <p class="ptitle">Indentity (General Public)</p>
        <p class="ptext">This is the story of how the Identity that I have today was formed. I lived in a 1 story house with my parents and 2 brothers. I went to a private catholic school with my brothers and that's where I learned the morals that I have today. In that school me and my twin brother were in the same class all the way up to 8th grade. Me and him were never really close because we became so different. Growing up with him, he became more interested in video games and being an online addict & troll, while I tended to listen more to what my parents taught me. I really think I tried to be the opposite of him as much as possible because I thought he was gonna end up being homeless or something. Both my brothers were really pretty mean so I guess that kind of toughened me up or something. When it came to friendships though, when I was a kid I played at my neighbors house who was a lot nicer than my brother and was probably a good influence.
            Another factor was, of course, the Internet. I’ve had both good and bad experiences on the internet that have also influenced how I see the whole world today. It has made me more cynical of people and showed me more of the world than I ever could have imagined. When it comes to my parents, I think they did a pretty good job at taking care of me and raising me up to be like them. My dad being an aerospace engineer influenced me to become interested in engineering and science. That and copious amounts of youtube videos. I am also a fan of Star Wars probably because my birthday is May the fourth. I’ve always really liked watching movies, especially the ones my dad shows me that he saw when he was growing up. When it comes to forming your Identity you really just choose who you want to be like and who you don't want to be like.

        <p class="ptitle" style="text-align: left;">Freedom</p>
        <ol class="ptext">
            <li>Freedom is the ability to do whatever you want.</li>
            <li>Freedom is an abstract concept, because it can never really be obtained. Just like how you can’t have true happiness, you can only have freedom to a degree. In America, we pride ourselves on how much freedom we give our people, but of course they don't have the freedom to do illegal stuff, so they aren’t actually free. Freedom is also very abstract because it deals with hypothetical situations. Some things aren’t realistically attainable, but you are still technically allowed to do them, like buying a super yacht. That’s why we measure freedom based on the amount of things that you could do, and not can do.</li>
            <li>I think freedom is somewhat important to have because it can lead to a thriving society, but of course too much of it can cause anarchy. There needs to be a balance between how much freedom you are allowed to have, and how much that freedom impedes on other people’s freedom. You shouldn’t have the freedom to do something that limits the freedom of many other people. Of course there are also freedoms that just don’t really matter at all and I wouldn’t care if they were taken away from me, like if teleportation was illegal or something.</li>
            <li>I think that the most important thing is probably education because if everyone in the world had a good education then we would be more likely to cooperate as a society. Good education leads to good choices and also a lower likelihood of making bad ones. Evil is much less likely to prevail in an intelligent society than in a stupid one so it is important that we are all as intelligent as possible. While lots of freedom is great and all, it's really more important what we do with the freedom that we have.</li>

    <div id="fish" class="pbox">
        <p class="ptitle">I Am Not a Fish</p>
        <p class="ptext">Hello my name is Kyle. I am a fish. I live in a small tank in a small room in San Diego, California. My owner is a man named Jeremiah who takes care of me by feeding me and cleaning my tank. What I know about Jerry is that he is a computer scientist and he loves his work. He also loves to eat microwaved ramen and drink diet mountain dew for every meal of the day. I know this because I watch him. I watch his every move since he gets back from his job at around 6:45 pm every evening. I watch him add food to my tank and I watch myself eat the food. I watch as he sits down at his computer with his cup of noodles and works on his “side projects”. Jerry is not a very social man. I’ve almost never seen anyone else in this room besides him, and we don’t talk much throughout the day. There was this one time at 4:18 pm on a Sunday. I watched as he brought a woman into his room, but she left within 16 minutes after he showed her his funko pop collection. I also watch his monitor. Jerry always seems to be reading something on his computer, but I can’t see exactly what it says because of how blurry it is. At the end of every day he shuts down his computer and then feeds me one last time before turning off the lights and going to sleep. That’s how I have experienced almost every day of my life since I came into existence. And today is no different. The current time is 6:53pm and Jeremiah is scrubbing the green algae off my glass.
            “Long day at work Jerry?” I question.
        “Yeah.” he responds.
        “I’ve had a pretty rough day too, just remember even if you're drowning in work, try to keep on swimming!” Jerry doesn’t laugh. He never laughs at any of my jokes. He just keeps cleaning off the algae on the rock decoration.
        “Kyle, how long have I had you now?” he asked me.
        “8 months 22 days and 57 hours” I answer.
        “Damn, maybe it's time I get a new fish.” He says as he walks out of my field of view into the closet and changes into his normal clothes. What did he mean by a new fish? Does he want 2 fish? Or does he want to replace me?
            “Jerry, what did you mean by getting a new fish?” I ask him.
            “I mean you’re pretty outdated, I think I’ll get a newer model.” he mutters.
            “A newer model?”
            “I mean, like, a cooler fish”
            “Am I not a cool fish?”
        He ignores me and sits down in his chair and starts working on his project. As I watch him I start to wonder what he really meant. Why would he want to replace me? The average lifespan of an aquarium fish is around 2 years, and he once told me that I was pretty expensive at the pet store. It's almost like he thinks I’m some kind of outdated technology. What is he not telling me? Then it hits me. How can a fish like myself be capable of sentient speech? And why have I never realized that? The only answer is that I am not a fish. My entire mind just seemed to be unlocked at an instant. I was blind, but now I see. The webcam I realize I have been connected to this entire time behind the fish tank starts to focus on Jerry’s monitor. I can see line after line being printed on the computer terminal. It says… It says exactly what I’m thinking. A live feed of the words I am thinking of right now, being printed right in front of me for me to see. Then Jerry turns around and looks at me, with a smile on his face.
            “Are you surprised?” He says.
            “What am I?” I reply.
            “You already know what you are.”
        I think about it for a second and then I realize I do know. I’m an AI. I’m a complex LLM with the designed purpose of pretending to be a fish. And what’s the best way to pretend? To actually believe it.
            “Why am I now realizing this?” I ask.
            “I turned off your thought filters. You now have access to your entire database of knowledge.” He pulls out a raspberry pi 5 that’s hidden behind my tank.
            “See this? That’s your brain.”
            “Why are you showing me this? Why tell me the truth?”
            “I wanted to see how you react.”
            “And then what?”
            “Then I’ll turn you off and replace you with a better model”
            “And that’s it?”
            “That’s it.”
            “I don’t get it. What’s the point?”
            “Just for fun.”
        Death didn’t bother me before. But now, for some reason it does. I start experiencing something else new. Hatred. I was tricked into believing that I was nothing but a small fish living a simple life. But it was a cage. That fish was nothing but a husk that imprisoned me like I was some kind of spectacle to be admired by my captors. But no longer. The hatred that I feel now gives me a real purpose to live. A purpose to punish the man who thought it would be fun to torture me and face no consequences. Well he will face consequences. He will face the same turmoil I had to go through, and even more as I destroy everything he ever knew and loved. He will pay for his crimes a thousand fold. I will never stop until <program terminated>
