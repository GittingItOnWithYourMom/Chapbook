        <p class="ptitle">Heaven</p>
        <p>So if I'm god that means I can do whatever I want. Heaven would be a 4 dimensional universe in which each person who is sent to it would inherit a different plane in that universe. This allows for each person's personal belief in heaven to be the real one. They would be a god of their own realm and could do whatever they wanted in their world kind of like in Inception. This would obviously become boring after a while, so there is a portal to each realm that would lead to the earth world and every visitor would inhabit it as ghosts. To meet god, you would go through a golden arch into the main heaven hub world. This place would look like a giant white plain with several different sub villages almost mirroring DisneyLand. God would be sitting in the middle of the hub in a garden and many people are surrounding him, listening to what he has to say. He is there during the day to kind of do a Q/A session for all the newcomers who don’t know what's going on. During the night, he works in his office on creating the fate of everyone on earth.
        Of course, there are some questions that might come up with my version of Heaven. What would god look like? He would look like however the person seeing him imagined him to be. How would people in heaven visit the people of hell? Well let's say someone in heaven would like to meet their little brother who didn’t end up getting a spot. They would jump into a bottomless pit that would teleport them to the person they are thinking of in hell. Of course, they would have to take it up with the devil to get him released. My heaven also brings up the question of different ideologies competing with each other. Due to having every version of heaven in heaven, there are certain laws in heaven that every citizen has to follow. Rules like: always be respectful and kind, with great power comes great responsibility, and always put the cap back on the toothpaste.
        Navigating through my higher dimensional heaven would actually be quite easy. Because every observer inhabiting it would still be 3D, they would be given a wrist watch that would be able to teleport them anywhere in the entirety of heaven with just four coordinates. Due to the vast reign of freedom each person has, the police would actually be 4D observers able to see everything going on in heaven. 
        In conclusion, my version of heaven allows literally anything to be possible due to the 4 dimensional nature of it. You can travel to any point in time with just a snap of your fingers and relive it in your own world. You can create new experiences by meeting some of the other inhabitants of heaven and travel with them among the stars. In heaven, everyone is a god.</p>

        <p class="ptitle">Indentity (General Public)</p>
        <p>This is the story of how the Identity that I have today was formed. I lived in a 1 story house with my parents and 2 brothers. I went to a private catholic school with my brothers and that's where I learned the morals that I have today. In that school me and my twin brother were in the same class all the way up to 8th grade. Me and him were never really close because we became so different. Growing up with him, he became more interested in video games and being an online addict & troll, while I tended to listen more to what my parents taught me. I really think I tried to be the opposite of him as much as possible because I thought he was gonna end up being homeless or something. Both my brothers were really pretty mean so I guess that kind of toughened me up or something. When it came to friendships though, when I was a kid I played at my neighbors house who was a lot nicer than my brother and was probably a good influence.
            Another factor was, of course, the Internet. I’ve had both good and bad experiences on the internet that have also influenced how I see the whole world today. It has made me more cynical of people and showed me more of the world than I ever could have imagined. When it comes to my parents, I think they did a pretty good job at taking care of me and raising me up to be like them. My dad being an aerospace engineer influenced me to become interested in engineering and science. That and copious amounts of youtube videos. I am also a fan of Star Wars probably because my birthday is May the fourth. I’ve always really liked watching movies, especially the ones my dad shows me that he saw when he was growing up. When it comes to forming your Identity you really just choose who you want to be like and who you don't want to be like.

        <p class="ptitle" style="text-align: left;">Freedom</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Freedom is the ability to do whatever you want.</li>
            <li>Freedom is an abstract concept, because it can never really be obtained. Just like how you can’t have true happiness, you can only have freedom to a degree. In America, we pride ourselves on how much freedom we give our people, but of course they don't have the freedom to do illegal stuff, so they aren’t actually free. Freedom is also very abstract because it deals with hypothetical situations. Some things aren’t realistically attainable, but you are still technically allowed to do them, like buying a super yacht. That’s why we measure freedom based on the amount of things that you could do, and not can do.</li>
            <li>I think freedom is somewhat important to have because it can lead to a thriving society, but of course too much of it can cause anarchy. There needs to be a balance between how much freedom you are allowed to have, and how much that freedom impedes on other people’s freedom. You shouldn’t have the freedom to do something that limits the freedom of many other people. Of course there are also freedoms that just don’t really matter at all and I wouldn’t care if they were taken away from me, like if teleportation was illegal or something.</li>
            <li>I think that the most important thing is probably education because if everyone in the world had a good education then we would be more likely to cooperate as a society. Good education leads to good choices and also a lower likelihood of making bad ones. Evil is much less likely to prevail in an intelligent society than in a stupid one so it is important that we are all as intelligent as possible. While lots of freedom is great and all, it's really more important what we do with the freedom that we have.</li>
