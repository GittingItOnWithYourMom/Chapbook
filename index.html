        <p class="ptitle">About the Author</p>
        <p>My hobbies include game development, electronics, watching movies, and trolling. I’m not a genius by any stretch of the imagination, but I do more than most in a lot of areas. My favorite subject is probably physics and I’m also a loser with no friends. I hope to get out of this dump as soon as possible and get into an ivy league school, then drop out after 2 years to start my billion dollar tech startup that I’ll sell to Microsoft and retire before 30.</p>
