            You must not fear the hard path
            You must not fear it’s fearful wrath
            Although the hard path may seem unforgiving
            At the end you will find all the giving

            When the fruits of our labor are rewarded
            Those on the easy path will not be awarded
            But the few who took all the risk
            Will stand on top an obelisk

            But if you think the pain is not worth the ending
            Think again, for it’s only about attending
            Because even when you might be screaming
            It's overcoming the fear that gives us meaning

        	And once you reach the end of the road
        	You’ll look back proud and old
        	So when you must pick between two paths
        	You must travel the hard path
        </p>
