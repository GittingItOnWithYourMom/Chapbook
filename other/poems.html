        <p style="text-align: left;" class="ptitle">The Hard Path</p>
        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap; text-align: left;">You must not fear the hard path
You must not fear it’s fearful wrath
Although the hard path may seem unforgiving
At the end you will find all the giving

When the fruits of our labor are rewarded
Those on the easy path will not be awarded
But the few who took all the risk
Will stand on top an obelisk

But if you think the pain is not worth the ending
Think again, for it’s only about attending
Because even when you might be screaming
It's overcoming the fear that gives us meaning

And once you reach the end of the road
You’ll look back proud and old
So when you must pick between two paths
You must travel the hard path</p>
