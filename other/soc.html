        <p>Green chalkboard is what einstein wrote on and he had a dog that died in ww2 or something? Then oppenheimer’s cat teleported to the multiverse and made a trilogy backstory like from starwars andthe letter j is the best one on the keyboard. And i must not stop typing because there is a trained assassin with a laser on my head like that trump shooter guy and the other guy that did that ceo in wait what am i writing oh no im letting the intrusive thoughts win uh pink elephant yeah the wether outside is frightful and holly jolly christmas the file explorer on chrome os is ass windows is so much better i would die before buying a macbook and submitting to the apple cult, although i know windows isnt perfect either i dont want to use linux yet so im kind of an idiot in that regard and in most other things to probably like my grade in this class which isn’t that bad but comparing my grades to other questies it kinda sucks which is why i hate this pathway and why im creating a seperatist alliance and starting my own pathway which will be superior and we will wait im not writing that hold on</p>
